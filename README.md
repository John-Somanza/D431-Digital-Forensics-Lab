<h1>TASK 1: INVESTIGATIVE PLAN OF ACTION</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

As more companies store information electronically, there is an increased need for digital forensics to discover the trails of illegal or malicious acts. In this task, you will use the scenario to develop an investigative plan of action that will prepare your investigative team to conduct an analysis on the gathered evidence.

<h2>Task Walk-Through:</h2>

A. Investigative Plan of Action

A1: Strategy for Maximizing Evidence Collection and Minimizing Impact:

STEP 1. Minimizing Disruption: 
-	Communicate with the necessary participants (IT department, HR, legal) to make sure that there will be minimal impacts for ongoing operations during the investigation process. 
 
STEP 2. Preserve Evidence Integrity:
-	Do this by following the best practices for forensic evidence integrity, such as maintaining the chain of custody, using write-blocking devise, and creating forensic images of relevant devices. These methods will ensure that the evidence will be preserved, analysis will be conducted without adjusting the original data, images can be used for verification and validation purposes, etc.
 
STEP 3. Targeted Approach:
-	The main targets we will be focusing on are ones that are directly involved with the suspected violation, such as specific systems, accounts, and data repositories. This will reduce the scope of the investigation and as a result, minimize the impact on unrelated areas.

A2: Tools and Techniques for evidence gathering, preparation, and analysis:

Forensic Software:
-	Industry-standard forensic tools such as Encase, AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK), or X-Ways Forensics will be applied for evidence acquisition and analysis.
     
Network Monitoring Tools:
-	Network monitoring tools will be implemented in order to capture network traffic as well as identify any unauthorized data transfers or access attempts.

Email and Communication Analysis: 
-	Email forensic tools such as ExMerge and Outlook Forensics will be implemented to analyze email headers, attachments, and communication patterns.

Data Recovery Tools:
-	Data recovery tools will be used to retrieve deleted files or fragments of evidence from relevant storage media.

A3: Collection and Preservation of Evidence:

Employ Standardized Procedures:
-	Conventional forensic procedures, such as those outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-86, will be used to ensure recognized evidence collection and preservation.
     
Create Forensic Images:
-	Forensic images will be created by forensic imaging tools in order to create bit-by-bit copies of relevant storage media to preserve data integrity.

Document the Chain of Custody:
-	At all times, a clear and documented chain of custody for all evidence will be maintained, recording who had access to it at each stage.

A4: Examination of Evidence:

File Analysis:
-	In order to identify appropriate files or documents that may have been accessed or shared without authorization, we will need to analyze file metadata, file access logs, and file contents.

Communication Analysis:
-	In order to identify any discussions or conversations of proprietary information, we will need to review email communications, instant messaging conversations, and other forms of electronic communication.

System and Network Logs;
-	Analysis of system and network logs will be enforced in order to find evidence of unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activities, or data transfers.

A5: Approach to Drawing Conclusions:

Corroborating Evidence:
-	When undergoing this process, it will be important to consider numerous pieces of digital evidence, such as access logs, timestamps, file metadata, and communication records. This will help to build a thorough case in supporting the claim of a policy violation.

Establishing Intent: 
-	When undergoing this process, it is important to look for patterns of behavior, actions, or communications that show intentional violation of policies rather than accidental or incidental access.

A6: Presentation of Details and Conclusions:

Summarize Findings:
-	Prepare a brief and clear summary of the investigationâ€™s findings, while highlighting key evidence and policy violations.

Provide Context:
-	Explain the possible negative impacts of the policy violation for the company, such as risks to intellectual property, client relationships, and competitive advantages.

Recommendations:
-	Give out recommendations for future actions, such as disciplinary measures, policy improvements, legal actions, etc. based on the conclusions drawn from the digital evidence.
